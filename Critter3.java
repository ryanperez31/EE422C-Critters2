/**
 * Critter3 is the ultimate pacifist. If it is prompted to fight, it would rather kill itself than actually fighting
 * which is exactly what it does. It suicides by "walking" a lot of times which results in its death. It's goal is to solely reproduce as
 * much as possible before it dies. Despite the stupidity of this strategy (because of energy loss), reproducing is all
 * this poor little creatures knows how to do. However, if it meets a friend (another Critter 3) during an encounter it simply tries to move away
 * rather than killing itself or fighting. Also there exist some Critter3's that have deformities that make them unable to reproduce, so they act
 * exactly like normal Critter3's but they can't reproduce, and there has been studies that suggest this is about a 10% chance of happening.
