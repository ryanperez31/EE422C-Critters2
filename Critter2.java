/**
 * Critter2 behaves in a way you might expect average cynical beings to behave. These critters have "families", which can be thought of as heritage. Critters
 * birth from the same parent will belong to the same "family" as their parent Critter2. When a Critter2 encounters a critter of a different species, it feels 
 * threatened and attempts to stand its ground and fight. However, when it comes into contact with another critter of the same species, and the two critters are born
 * from different parents, the two Critter2s will mate and one of them will give birth to a child. Critter2s who come in contact but are born from the same
 * parent/family will not mate, since they do not believe in incest, but will also not fight, because they are family. Instaed, fate will choose which of the 
 * members gets to live.
